# iot_for_home
Using ESP32 to design a system to control many appliances automatically or manually through a self-designed website.
The project aims to design a kit to automate home appliances with following functions:
+ System can run in one of two modes: Manual Mode or Automation Mode.
+ In Manual Mode, user controls the applicances (fan, bulb) through many buttons and timer to turn off.
+ In Automation Mode, system will decide the status of appliances (on or off) through data read from sensors (light sensor, temperature sensor).
+ Status is stored on Firebase. 
+ Design a website use HTML/CSS/Javascript to remotely control the system.
+ Locally control through button on kit or remotely control through the websites.
+ All local functions can remotely done through the website.
